// You're right in landing here, this logically is where you would find the table desccription for the project table, however there is no "project table" and only a "view" built from the event stream.


// You'll find the table description in {projectRoot}/cqrs/views/project-view.ts or you can "go to definition" below

// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
import type { IProjectView } from "$lib/cqrs/views/project"
